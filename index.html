              <p class="card-text">Demon Hunters are the kings of mobility in raids and dungeons. In general, they can move around more and more quickly than many other specs, thanks to Infernal Strike Icon Infernal Strike, as well as various talents that aid their mobility. Additionally, they excel at burst AoE damage, with many abilities dealing AoE and cleave damage. They also excel at dungeon utility with their sigils.

                Vengeance Demon Hunter gameplay features a mix between healing and damage mitigation, with low-cost but low-uptime of active mitigation, the ability to mitigate magic damage well, and extremely high burst healing potential.</p>
